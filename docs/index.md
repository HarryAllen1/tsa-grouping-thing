# TSA Team Creation Wizard Documentation

## About

This tool was originally created to assist with team creation, but has gradually evolved into a full TSA membership system, with the ability to manage members, assist with regionals and state registration, provide feedback on submissions, and post rankings. Although this site was originally only supposed to last a year, I've tried my best to make it work for the forseeable years. If anything doesn't seem to be working correctly, or you want a new feature, feel free to contact me.

This documentation site is intended to aid with using and navigating the team creation wizard, which, at this point, has become quite a complicated tool, which can often be overwhelming. In the sidebar, there are pages on how to use every single feature and navigate every single page on the site.
