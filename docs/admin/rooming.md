# Rooming

Rooming is just an event with slight restrictions on who can be in a team. Everybody is automatically in the rooming event when the "Show rooming" switch is on. It also provides a button in the top right of the event that will download the rooms in a `.csv` file so you can easily paste it into the rooming template.

The rooming event can be shown or hidden with the "Show rooming" toggle directly above the team cards. Typically, you'll want to keep this toggle off until you get closer to state. This switch is different from the "Lock rooming" button as it modifies the visibility of the event to all members, whereas the "Lock rooming" button is independent of the "Show rooming" button, and when toggled, prevents modification of the rooms, even if it is shown to members.

## Restrictions

Besides the wording of a few things, the only major difference is who can be in a room with each other. In the member view, members can still create teams/rooms as normal, except the only people they can add to their room must be of the same gender. Non-binary people can be added do any room.

## Exporting to Rooming Template

For state, a rooming template must be created. However, it as a rather particular format. The Team Creation Wizard provides a way to convert its format into the rooming template.

Once you have your rooming complete, at the top of the rooming card in the admin page, there is a download button to the left of the delete event button. When you click it, a CSV file will be downloaded. Once it is downloaded, open the file in Excel or some other form of spreadsheeting programme. Copy all of the data provided except for the header row, and paste the data into <!-- cannot be handled by router--> <a href="/Rooming%20template.xlsx" target="_blank">your rooming template</a>\*. Make sure you paste the data into the >= D column, otherwise you will overwrite important information. You'll still need to add chaperones and advisors to this template, but besides that, it should be ready to send. For each room, you will also need to assign a gender to each room.

\*This rooming template is from 2024, so make sure to update the year. There might be a newer version, but, historically, not much has changed in the template.
