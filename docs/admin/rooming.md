# Rooming

Rooming is just an event with slight restrictions on who can be in a team. Everybody is automatically in the rooming event when the "Show rooming" switch is on. It also provides a button in the top right of the event that will download the rooms in a `.csv` file so you can easily paste it into the rooming template.

The rooming event can be shown or hidden with the "Show rooming" toggle directly above the team cards. Typically, you'll want to keep this toggle off until you get closer to state. This switch is different from the "Lock rooming" button as it modifies the visibility of the event to all members, whereas the "Lock rooming" button is independent of the "Show rooming" button, and when toggled, prevents modification of the rooms, even if it is shown to members.

## Restrictions

Besides the wording of a few things, the only major difference is who can be in a room with each other. In the member view, members can still create teams/rooms as normal, except the only people they can add to their room must be of the same gender. Non-binary people can be added do any room.
