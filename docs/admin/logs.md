# Logs

Logs are used to see what member did what action. You can access it through the [logs page](https://tsa-grouping-thing.vercel.app/admin/logs).

::: info
The logs page dosen't keep track of changes made to any files (for example, when files are uploaded for submissions or rubrics are returned). This is due to a limitation of the database itself and is not a feature which will be added in the future.
:::

The logs page is meant to keep track of _all_ changes. Thus, the logs are displayed in JSON format. In the table displayed, you can see the person who did the change, when that change happened, as well as a button to view the log.

When you click the View log button, there is a lot of data all at once. At the top of the dialog (you might have to scroll up), you will see the database path in which the change happened
