# Event Logs

This page shows actions performed by every user for every event. Useful for tracking member complaints or curing curiosity.

It does **NOT** log:

- Changes people make to their account (name, gender, events, etc.),
- Changes preformed by admins on the admin teams page,
- Results changes, or
- File changes (submission uploads, file uploads).

It DOES log:

- All request changes,
- Rooming changes,
- Cardboard boat changes (i.e., team name),
- All team changes (member removal and addition, team captains, etc.).
