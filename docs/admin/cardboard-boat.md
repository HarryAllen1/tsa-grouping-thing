# Cardboard Boat

The Cardboard Boat (labeled \*Cardboard Boat) is an event to assist members in creating forming Cardboard Boat teams. The registration for Cardboard Boat is separate from regular event registration and typically occurs via a Google Form which can be submitted at the conference.

## Enabling Cardboard Boat

You can add the Cardboard Boat event to everybody's home teaming page by clicking the cog icon in the top right of the event and clicking "Show event to everybody."

## Functionality

Fundamentally, the Cardboard Boat event functions identically to a regular event. The only difference is that teams do not have a team captain and teams are able to rename themselves. The teaming site does not have the ability to automatically moderate team names, so admins will have to do so manually.
