# Submissions

The submissions page provides a simplified way to grade submissions from in-house eliminations as well as posting those results. It removes the clutter from the admin teams page and reduces it to solely the team members, their submissions, a way to edit the submission description, and a way to post the results. It also hides team member names for fairness (as board members often grade submissions).
