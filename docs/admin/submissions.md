# Submissions

The submissions page provides a simplified way to grade submissions from in-house eliminations as well as posting those results. It removes the clutter from the admin teams page and reduces it to solely the team members, their submissions, a way to edit the submission description, and a way to post the results. It also hides team member names for fairness (as board members often grade submissions).

## Those things at the top

There are some buttons and toggles at the top of the page:

### Refresh All

Due to technical limitations outside of my control, the files shown on this page do not refresh live. To refresh the files which you see, click the "Refresh all" button. This will refresh all the files on the page. You can also refresh a specific event with the "Refresh" button under each team.

### Hide teams without submissions

Some teams sign up for events knowing full well they won't do anything in them. This might lead to a number of teams in an event which don't have events, and might just be clogging up the grading process. Click the "Hide teams without submissions" button to...hide all the teams without submissions.

### Show team member names

By default, all team members' names are hidden from you -- the judge. This is to ensure fairness -- after all, many judges are board members or parents or advisors and might be biased towards certain teams. Sometimes, though, it is necessary to see which members are in an event. Click this toggle to show all team members' names.
