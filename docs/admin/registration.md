# Registering for Regionals and State

The WA regionals and state registration page is really bad. As this team creation wizard's database is different from WTSA's, normally, a lot of work (sometimes hours) must be put in to transfer data across systems. This can be rather tedious, as the event modification page looks like this:

So, to help streamline the transferring of events and other data, I've made a tool.

## Prerequisites

This tool is hosted on GitHub, and must be download and ran on your computer.

This tool relies on NodeJS, [so download that first.](https://nodejs.org/en). Verify it works by opening the Command Prompt app and typing `node -v` followed by enter. You should se something similar to the following (the exact numbers might differ):

```
v20.9.0
```

Once you've downloaded and installed NodeJS, you will then need to get the code. Head to the tools [GitHub repo](https://github.com/HarryAllen1/tsa-uploader-but-better) and download the code by pressing the green "Code" button, downloading as zip, and extracting the files (if you know how, you can also clone the repo with git).

## Prepping the Tool

Once you have the folder open in File Explorer (you should see multiple files, not one folder. You might need to enter another folder), you'll need to copy the path. Do this by clicking the URL bar and copying it:

![file explorer](./copy%20path.png)
