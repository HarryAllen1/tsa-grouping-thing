# Registering for Regionals and State

The WA regionals and state registration page is really bad. As this team creation wizard's database is different from WTSA's, normally, a lot of work (sometimes hours) must be put in to transfer data across systems. This can be rather tedious, as the event modification page looks like this:

So, to help streamline the transferring of events and other data, ~~I've made a tool.~~ I've just realized how dangerous this tool is, so there is absolutely no way I'm distributing it. I've instead included instructions on how to manually register everyone.

## Getting the Data

One of the hardest parts of registering everyone for state is the difficulty of staring at massive amounts of data. There are two ways to transfer data to the registration system:

- Exporting the data to a CSV file, and using Excel to transfer the data
- Using the [members page](https://tsa-grouping-thing.vercel.app/admin/members)
