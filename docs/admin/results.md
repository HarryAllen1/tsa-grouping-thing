# Results

This page exists to help to determine placement of eliminations. It also provides a way to return rubrics back to teams. There are actually 2 ways to add results: through the results page and through the [submissions page](./submissions.md). It is easier to add results from the submissions page, but provides less flexability as to who can be in each result team (for example, it would be impossible to generate results for tech bowl eliminations through the submissions page as people take the test separately). If you already know the teams and placement for each ranking, you should probably use the submissions page. If you want to manage/change the results or do anything else with results, you should probably use the results page.
