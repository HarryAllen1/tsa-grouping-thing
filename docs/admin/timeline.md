# Timeline of Usage

Throughout the school year, various settings will need to be changed and various features will need to be used. This page outlines a rough schedule and timeline for how the site is designed to be used. Just because this timeline is laid out here in this order does not mean that it must be used like this.

## Start of school year

Members sign into the site, complete intake, and create teams.

## Fall

Eliminations are held. You can use the "Events without member overlap" section underneath each event detail to assist in planning events (using this ensures that members will avoid participating in multiple eliminations in a single day). After each elimination, the event is narrowed to the advancing teams and [results are posted](./results.md). [The "Lock team creation when full" switch](./teams.md#lock-team-creation-when-full) is enabled for that event to prevent necessitating additional eliminations.

## Late Fall/early Winter

All events are locked. [Accounts are locked](./members.md#lock-all-accounts). Members are [affiliated at the National level](./registration.md#registering-students-for-membership). [Registration for the January Qualifier](./registration.md#registering-for-the-state-conference) is completed.

## Winter

Eliminated teams are deleted. ["Lock team creation" is enabled](./teams.md#lock-team-creation) for all events to stay within State limits whilst allowing some degree of reshuffling. [Rubrics are returned](./teams.md#files) to each team from the January Qualifier.

## Late Winter

[Rooming](./rooming.md) and [cardboard boat](./cardboard-boat.md) is enabled for members.

## Late Winter/early Spring

Events are locked again. [State registration](./registration.md#registering-for-the-state-conference) is completed a second time.

## Late Spring

Old rubrics are deleted (this is easier to do with direct database access -- just delete the folder in Firebase).

[Rubrics are returned](./teams.md#files).

## Summer

[The system is reset](./resetting.md) for the next school year.
