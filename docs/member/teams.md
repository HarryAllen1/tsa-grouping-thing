# Teams

This is the main landing page for members once they first login. It provides tools for members to manage their events and teams.

## Changing Events

To change events, there is a large green button which will direct to a page allowing members to change their events. More info on that page can be found [here.](./signup.md)

## Managing Teams

Once a member has signed up for an event, they can then create or join teams for that event. To create a team, press the "Create Team" button towards the bottom of the team card.
