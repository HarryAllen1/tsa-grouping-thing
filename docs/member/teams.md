# Teams

This is the main landing page for members once they first login. It provides tools for members to manage their events and teams.

## Changing Events

To change events, there is a large green button which will direct to a page allowing members to change their events. More info on that page can be found [here.](./signup.md)

## Managing Teams

Once a member has signed up for an event, they can then create or join teams for that event. To create a team, press the "Create Team" button towards the bottom of the team card.

You can only create a team if you are not already in an existing team.
When you create a team, you will automatically be added to that team. To add other people to the team, click the green add person icon:

![adding a person to a team](./add%20people%20to%20team.png)

This will bring up a dialog contianing the people that can be added to the team. The only people who appear in this dialog are people who have signed up for the event and are not already in another team. Click the plus icon on the right of a person's name to add them to the team. Once a person is added to a team, they cannot be kicked out. The only way for a person to be removed is for that person to leave the team, or for an admin to remove them.

To leave a team, click the red leave team icon. If you are the last person in a team and you leave it, the team will be deleted.
