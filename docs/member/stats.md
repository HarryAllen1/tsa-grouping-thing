# Statistics

Really, the only relevant statistic on this page is the event stuff at the top. If the bar is red, the event requires eliminations as the WA Entry Limit has been exceeded. If it's yellow, eliminations should be considered as the event limit is close. If it's blue, that means no team can be formed as the number of people signed up for the event is fewer than the minimum team size.
