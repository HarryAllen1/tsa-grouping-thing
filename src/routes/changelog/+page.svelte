				<strong>New domain</strong>: This app now runs off of
				<a href="/">teaming.jhstsa.org</a>! You can now also find event
				information at
				<a href="https://jhstsa.org" target="_blank">jhstsa.org</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Offline support</strong>: This app now works offline. If this
				app was previously loaded on a device and you lose access to the
				internet (like during the State conference), you will still be able to
				view your teams and events.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Messaging</strong>: To avoid the annoyances of setting up
				initial communication with a team, this app now allows you to message
				team members. Please note that messages are moderated and can be seen by
				both board members and advisors.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Intake form</strong>: To assist with registration, new and
				returning members will be prompted to fill out an intake form. You can
				edit your responses at any time by visiting the
				<a href="/account">account</a> page.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Theming</strong>: Sometimes, the look of an app gets boring over
				time. You can now change the theme colour in addition to the light and
				dark modes. Click the paintbrush icon in the top-right to get started.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Removed sound effects</strong>: They were added as a joke and
				eventually became annoying. They're completely gone now. Confetti is
				cool, so still remains.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Various infrastructure improvements</strong>: The app has been
				optimized a bunch, significantly reducing initial load times. If you
				wish to view the source code, it is available on
				<a
					href="https://github.com/HarryAllen1/tsa-grouping-thing"
					target="_blank">Github</a
				>.
